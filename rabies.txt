            <h1>WHAT IS RABIES?</h1>
			<p>• Rabies is a severe viral disease that affects the central nervous
system (CNS) of mammals. Rabies is caused by a neurotropic virus of
the family Rhabdoviridae, genus Lyssavirus, subgroup rabies virus.</p>
<p>• The average incubation period of human rabies is between 1-3
months.In 90-95 % of cases,incubation period is less than one year
but may be longer in 5-10 % cases. The duration ofthe incubation
period depends on certain factors:
- The amount ofthe virus inoculated into the wound or mucosa.
- Severity of exposure - Patients with multiple and/or deep
penetrating bite wounds may have shorter incubation period.
- Location of exposure - Patients with bite wounds in highly
innervated areas and/or close to the central nervous system may
have shorter incubation period.</p>
<p>• The origin ofthe word rabies is either from the Sanskrit "rabhas"
(to do violence) or the Latin "rabere" (to rage). The ancient Greeks
called rabies "lyssa" (violence).</p>
<p>• Rabies appears to have originated in the Old World,the first
epizootic in the New World occurring in Boston in 1768. Rabies was
considered a scourge for its prevalence in the 19th century.</p>

 <h1>PATHOGENESIS</h1>
 <p> After inoculation, the rabies virus multiplies in the muscle
cells (myocytes or may invade the nerve directly without
prior multiplication in the myocytes. It is possible that the
rabies virus may persist locally at the site of inoculation
for an unspecified period of time. This could explain the
long incubation period for some rabies infections. The
virus then penetrates the peripheral nerve cells via viral
uptake at neuronal endings. The virus is transported
through both the sensory and motor nerve fibers to the
central nervous system (CNS). In vitro studies show that
velocity of axonal transport of the virus ranges from 25 to
50 mm per day. The spread of the rabies virus in the
coulometer and optic nerves could be as fast as 12
mm/day. Once the virus reaches the CNS, rabies
replication occurs primarily in the neurons or brain cells
through viral budding and the virus spreads and infects
the nearby brain cells. Dissemination through the
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) occurs in the late stages of
infection. While viral dissemination occurs in the central
nervous system, the rabies virus spreads into the
peripheral tissues such as muscle fibers, salivary glands,
corneas, adrenal medullae, lacrimal glands, myocardium,
kidneys, lungs, pancreas and epidermis. Infection of
salivary glands allows further transmission of the disease
to other mammals. </p>


			<h1>CLINICAL STAGES</h1>
			<h2>1 . PRODROMAL</h2>
			<p> Occurs when there is initial viral replication atthe striated
muscle cells atthe site ofinoculation just before it enters the brain.
The virus then spreads centripetally up the nerve to the central
nervous system through the
peripheral nerve axoplasm.
<p> This stage lasts for 0-10 days with non-specific manifestations,
which include fever, sore throat, anorexia, nausea, vomiting,
generalized body malaise, headache and abdominal pain.
Paresthesia or pain atthe site of bite is due to viral multiplication at
the spinal ganglion just before it enters the brain.

            <h2>2. ACUTE NEUROLOGIC</h2>

<p> The acute neurologic stage is the stage when the virus reaches the
CNS and replicates most exclusively within the gray matter.
<p> This stage has two types of presentation: encephalitic or furious
type, which is presentin 80% of rabies cases, and paralytic or
dumb type, which is seen in 20%.
<p> This stage lasts for 2-7 days.
<p> Manifestations: hyperactivity, hypersalivation, disorientation and
hallucination, bizarre behavior interspersed
with lucid intervals, seizures, nuchal rigidity or paralysis.

					<td>Acute progressive ascending myelitis, symmetrical or
asymmetrical with flaccidp
aralysis, pain and fasciculation
in the affected muscles with mild
sensory disturbance. A complete paraplegia develops
eventually with fatal paralysis
of the respiratory and
pharyngeal muscles.</td>
					<td>Hyperactivity (anxiety, agitation,
running, biting, bizarre behavior
alternating with periods of calm) which may occur spontaneously or may be precipitated by tactile or
auditory, visual or other stimuli. The most characteristic symptom is
spasm of the pharyngeal muscles
often triggered by an attempt tod
rink water (hydrophobia) or by
blowing air on patient's face
(aerophobia). Spasmodic
contractions of the muscles may
spread to the respiratory and
other muscles leading to attacks of
apnea.

			<h1>LABORATORY DIAGNOSIS</h1>
			<h3>FLUORESCENT ANTIBODY TESTING ( FA)
</h3>
			
			<p>The Fluorescent Antibody (FA) technique is the gold standard for rabies
diagnosis.Itis a rapid and sensitive test based on microscopic examination
under ultravioletlight. Tissue samples from brainstem,thalamus, cerebellum
and the hippocampus (Ammon’s horn) are recommended for increased
sensitivity ofthe test.
</p>

<h3>POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION (PCR)
</h3>
			
			<p>The Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is a laboratory technique for
"amplifying" a specific DNA sequence. PCR is extremely efficient and sensitive;it
can make millions or billions of copies of any specific sequence of DNA, even
when the sequence is in a complex mixture.
</p>

<h3>SEROLOGY
</h3>
			
			<p>Serum Rapid Fluorescent Focus Inhibition Test (RFFIT). Serum neutralization
assays are used to determine the potency of rabies serum and
immunoglobulins used for PEP, and to evaluate the immunogenicity of human
and,to a lesser degree, animal rabies vaccines.
</p>

<h3>HISTOLOGIC FINDINGS
</h3>
			
			<p>Negri bodies or Cerebral inclusion bodies are round cytoplasmic inclusions of
assembling nucleocapsid are pathognomonic of rabies infection, but are found
in only about 80% of cases. The biting animal should be examined for rabies.

</p>


<h3>TRANSMISSION</h3>
			
			<p> Transmission is almost always by the bite or scratch of an infected
animal, when the saliva containing the rabies virus is introduced
into the body. The virus can be in the body for weeks before signs
develop. The virus can also be transmitted by saliva ifit comes into
contact with the eyes, mouth, or nose.</p>

		<h3>SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS</h3>
			
			<p> Fever
            <p> Headache
            <p> Nausea
            <p> Vomitting
			<p> Agitation
            <p> Anxiety
            <p> Confusion
            <p> Hyperactivity
			<p> Dysphagia
            <p> Excessive salivation
            <p> Hydrophobia
			<p> Aerophobia
            <p> Hallucinations
            <p> Insomia </p>
			
			<h1>HOW TO TREAT ANIMAL BITES?</h1>
			<p> Treatment depends on the location ofthe bite,the overall health
condition ofthe bitten person and whether or notthe dog is
vaccinated against rabies. The main principles of care include:
<p> • irrigation and cleansing ofthe wound;
<p> • primary closure ifthe wound is low-risk for developing infection;.
<p> • prophylactic antibiotics for high-risk wounds or people with
immune deficiency;
<p> • rabies post-exposure treatment depending on the dog vaccination
status;
<p> • administration oftetanus vaccine ifthe person has not been
adequately vaccinated. </p>

<h1>HOW TO PREVENT RABIES?</h1>

<p> • Vaccinating your pets like dogs,including puppies,is the most cost effective strategy for preventing rabies in people because it stops the
transmission atits source.
<p> • Education on dog behaviour and bite prevention for both children
and adults.
<p> • Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)
<p> • Keep your pets inside and supervise them when outside. This will
help keep your pets from coming in contact with wild animals.
<p> • Immunization of people
<p> • Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) </p>
